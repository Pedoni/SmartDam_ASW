# SmartDam_ASW

## Requirements
This project requires Docker installed. Each container (backend, frontend and sensors) will manage its own dependencies on the fly.

If you want to run only one module of this project stand-alone outside of a container, here are the requirements:
 - `backend`: nodejs, npm
 - `frontend`: nodejs, npm
 - `waterlevel_sensor`: python 3, pip
 - `weather_sensor`: python 3, pip

## For local development
First, make sure to have compiled all the `*.scss` files inside `dam_frontend`. To do so, run
`make sass` inside the `dam_frontend` folder.

Run `make dev`, then:
 - the frontend will be available [here](localhost:8080)
 - the backend will be available [here](http://localhost:3000)

### Testing
You can run the unit tests implemented for the backend by running `make test` inside the `dam_backend` folder.

### Cleanup
Run `make down` to remove containers and docker networks.

## For production
First, make sure to have compiled all the `*.scss` files inside `dam_frontend`. To do so, run
```bash
cd dam_frontend
make sass
```

Run `make prod`, then:
 - the frontend will be available [here](localhost:8080)
 - the backend will be available [here](http://localhost:3000)

### Cleanup
Run `make down` to remove containers and docker networks.

## Running modules as standalone
### dam_backend
You can run the dam_backend module as a standalone app if you have Nodejs and npm installed. First run `npm install` and then `npm start [mongodb-connection-string]`.

### dam_frontend
You can run the dam_backend module as a standalone app if you have npm installed. First run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then run `npm run build` to build the application. At this point you just need a static file server to serve the website now generated inside the `dist` folder. Our choice is the package `serve`. You can install it with `npm install -g serve` and then you can run `make serve`.
